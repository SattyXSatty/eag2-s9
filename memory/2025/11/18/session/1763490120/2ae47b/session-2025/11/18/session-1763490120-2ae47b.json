For Harmanpreet, every run in Jemimah Rodrigues\\' epochal 127* that took India closer to a monumental victory over the defending champions was a reminder of that underdog victory years ago. Her team was on the cusp of long-awaited glory now.\\\\n\\\\nSo, when India finally ended their World Cup trophy drought on Sunday, Harmanpreet\\'s zealous, seemingly spontaneous, sing-along with Malhotra to \\'*Sadda Haq*\\' wasn\\'t just celebration - it was the realisation of a long-cherished and shared dream.\\\\n\\\\nNot just Malhotra, former captains Jhulan Goswami, Anjum Chopra and Mithali Raj were also a part of the broadcast that switched from analysis to celebrations midway as the team enveloped the quartet in their victory lap. Former legends Diana Edulji, Shubhangi Kulkarni and Sudha Shah, as well as former long-time team manager Trupti Bhattacharya too were handed over the long-awaited trophy.\\\\n\\\\nFor a teary Goswami, it was the fulfilment of a two-way promise.\\\\n\\\\nBack in the 2022 edition, when India were knocked out by the same opponent, South Africa, Goswami\\'s dream slipped away as she sat helplessly in the dugout, sidelined by a side strain. That night, in her hotel room, Harmanpreet and Smriti Mandhana vowed: \\\\\"We\\'ll lift the next World Cup for you.\\\\\" The veteran pacer, a mentor to both in the national setup, just smiled through her tears and replied, \\\\\"Then, no matter what, I\\'ll be there to see it happen.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nShe kept her word when India knocked out the defending champions. Taking a brief break from her duties at the CAB, Goswami flew to Navi Mumbai for the title clash of the home World Cup, where Mandhana and Harmanpreet fulfilled theirs. In front of 40,000 roaring spectators and another 330 million watching from home, the promise found its perfect ending.\\\\n\\\\nFor all its statistics and scorelines, sport often comes down to friendships, belief, and shared journeys. And as the Indian team celebrated late into the night, they made sure those who had paved the way were part of that moment too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I did not expect that they\\'ll stop the broadcast for 10 minutes only to let us enjoy the moment and be a part of those celebrations,\\\\\" Goswami recalls in a chat with Cricbuzz. \\\\\"We saw the victory lap coming towards us and we were hoping we could catch a couple of players for a quick interview. But the way we became a part of that victory lap is something that will always remain very special to me, to all of us.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTo the leading wicket-taker in WODIs, this is a career highlight that ranks way above all her personal achievements despite not being a part of the winning XI. Goswami feels it was the magnanimity of the team\\'s leadership duo that helped create a core memory for former stars like her. \\\\\"Harman and Smriti may be big names, but they have even bigger hearts. They are different,\\\\\" the veteran pacer beams.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Making us a part of their celebrations was a huge tribute this team paid to us even in what was their moment of glory. It shows that they didn\\'t forget their history, that they didn\\'t ignore their roots. I don\\'t think anyone has given ex-cricketers a tribute as special as this on the ground. This was a hugely special moment for me, and for the entire women\\'s cricket fraternity who has ever been a part of this journey. This was everyone\\'s win.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/2048x1152/i1/c781026/reema-malhotra-was-one-of-the-former-cricketers-who-was-part-of-the-grand-celebrations-photo-credit-reema-malhotra.jpg]\\\\n\\\\nMalhotra concurs. \\\\\"Harman and Smriti are the pillars of this team. They didn\\'t keep the win to themselves. The team didn\\'t celebrate their win - they shared it with the whole country.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMalhotra narrates what set this batch of 2025 apart from the previous ones that made the World Cup final, but faltered. \\\\\"I can only talk about the 2005 side that made the final for the first time. In the dressing room, we only repeatedly spoke about one thing throughout - \\'we have to make the final\\'. And when we reached the finals, we were over the moon. *Kyunki, humari tayaari sirf final tak ki thi na*. Nobody ever said trophy *uthana hai* [We\\'d only kept the final as the end goal, not the trophy].\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This team, on the other hand, always had the belief they can go all the way. I remember asking Richa [Ghosh] after the final celebrations. I asked her if that team song they revealed in their celebrations mid-pitch - was it spontaneous or was it all mugged up, because everybody was in perfect sync. She said, \\'after every game, every practice session, every loss, every win, we sang this song because we had the belief we can win\\'.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Call it manifestation, call it positive vibes, call it the universe conspiring to make it happen for them in front of the home crowd, but it happened only because the team collectively was only looking at one goal - to lift that trophy. Despite those three heavy defeats in the middle [of their campaign], they team rose like champions, to become the champions, which goes on to show the power of visualisation and collective positive thinking as a group. This team only ever talked about winning that trophy, not just reaching the final. That mindset was the difference.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nGoswami echoes: \\\\\"Harman and Smriti are special, but at the same time you cannot ignore others. Everyone played their part, and more importantly, everyone had a single-minded focus. That\\'s where Smriti and Harman have played a big role in this dressing room. They ensured everyone was on the same page, and only good things come out of such a dedicated approach. That positive mindset reflected in their body language, in their attitude on the field. Not just in the final, but even in that three-match period where they lost heavily, their self-belief never wavered. And that\\'s where this think-tank made all the difference.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMalhotra lauded the team\\'s intent, in good times and bad, to pull them through. \\\\\"This intent didn\\'t come overnight - it\\'s a result of WPL. It\\'s a result of playing with overseas cricketers, it\\'s a result of playing high-pressure matches day in day out. It\\'s come from having a coach like Amol Muzumdar in the dressing room, who may have never played for India but knows how to score the tough runs consistently, who knows what intent and approach should be like at this level. Pool of players has increased, awareness has increased, job opportunities will increase ensuring future security.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This win is going to be massive for the women\\'s sport in the country. All they have to do now is learn to make it a habit.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow after a historic first, Malhotra thinks, this team can actually command \\'*sadda haq, ethe rakh\\'*.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The way this think-tank wants to take this team forward should be Harman and Smriti\\'s call now, not anyone else\\'s. Whether they want to continue with the same process and same pace, or whether Harman wants to pass on the baton, or pass on the baton eventually at what stage, has to be her call now.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I believe now the selectors don\\'t have to be the ones deciding for them, it\\'s something they need to discuss, they need to ask Smriti and Harman what they want for the team going forward. This right to make their own decisions now is a well deserved one after winning an ICC trophy we\\'ve waited five decades for; *bataye jaane ka time ab chala gaya*[the time to be handed out instructions is gone now].\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"There were times, not too long ago, the players were never asked. Times when we\\'d hide injuries, when we had no say - we did what the selectors or the administrations told us. Now, it has to be the players\\' call - this is what I would like to see in terms of change.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"That\\'s the legacy this will leave, I feel. Now on, things aren\\'t going to be dictated to them, but they will be a part of the discussion. I\\'m not saying they are above the selectors now - the selectors have their own place in the system as they should. But, now the players need to get that space, they deserve that open discussion about what they want going forward, about what they need to take this team forward. This is the team they wanted, right, and they won you the trophy with that very team, right? Now is the time to trust their decisions.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFor Malhotra, this win brings more than just a trophy to the cabinet - it\\'s the start of a cultural change in Indian women\\'s cricket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"From *ye team jeet sakti hai*, to*ye team ab jeet-ti hai* [form \\'this team can win\\' to \\'this team is the winner\\'] is what\\'s going to create a massive impact. This champion side is going to create a new, bigger fan base. This team will inspire many new generations to come.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"In 2017, when the team reached the finals in the public eye, it created a buzz. People got to know who Harman or who Smriti is, India learnt about more players over and above Mithali and Jhulan who were synonyms with women\\'s cricket in the country. That was the impact of a final loss.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Now, just yesterday, I was at the U-23 Delhi trials - 272 girls turned up instead of the usual 100-120 until last year. That\\'s three days after the World Cup win! Parents will now realise that this can be a career-choice for their girls, that there\\'s a future here. The team is meeting the Prime Minister, the President of the country. Social media is still talking about them, their game, their celebrations - the buzz hasn\\'t died down at all.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This will invariably increase the player pool. We will have ready replacements. There\\'s very soon going to be a problem of plenty, which is what everyone wants, which is what makes a champion team. [India] men\\'s set-up can simultaneously make two very strong squads for internationals now-a-days, and in another couple of years\\' time, I\\'m sure, the women\\'s team will be able to achieve that too.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nLooking ahead, Goswami notes that this triumph has the potential to reshape the future of women\\'s sport in the country.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This win will motivate and encourage all the cricket associations to provide better support, better facilities to their women\\'s sides equally. End of the day, it\\'s all about preparation. This success is definitely going to be a game-changer for women\\'s cricket in the country, right from the domestic level.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMalhotra delves a little deeper into the structural support at the domestic level that will be key to sustaining this success.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The board needs to be commended for the step-by-step progress - amping up domestic fees, introducing WPL, pay parity, ensuring equal facilities. But not the only way to ensure this becomes a fool-proof system for young girls is that the domestic cricketers get the same security to stick around. Not everyone goes on to play for India and that shouldn\\'t discourage girls into giving up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Your national coach is the biggest example - Muzumdar never played international cricket but in a different India set-up he helmed the team to its first-ever World Cup. Similarly, maybe there are more players around us who aren\\'t able to crack the India level yet but if they get that job security in the domestic set-up, maybe they will be able to fully dedicate themselves and give their 100%. This is one change I want to see, and I\\'m sure the board will pay heed.\\\\\"\"}'\n\n    summary = \"\"\"India's victory at the World Cup was more than just a win; it was the culmination of years of hard work and a two-way promise between former and current players.
